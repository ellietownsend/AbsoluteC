/*A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly used in diet soda can cause death in laboratory mice. Your friend, who wants to lose weight but can't give up soda, wants to know how much diet soda can be safely consumed without the risk of death.
 
 Write a C++ program to calculate the answer.
 Input to the program:
 • The amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a mouse (use 5 grams)
 • The mass of the mouse (use 35 grams)
 • The weight at which the dieter will stop dieting (use 45400 grams for a 100-pound person)Assumptions:
 • The lethal dose for a mouse is proportional to the lethal dose for a human.
 • A single can of soda has a mass of 350 grams.
 • Diet soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener.
 
 Instructions:
 • Use a const variable declaration to name this fraction.
 • Express the percentage as the double value 0.001.
 • The program should allow the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes.
