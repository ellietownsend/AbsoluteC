/*Write a program that outputs all 99 stanzas of the “Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer
on the Wall” song. Your program should print the number of bottles in English,
not as a number:
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall,
Ninety-nine bottles of beer,
Take one down, pass it around,
Ninety-eight bottles of beer on the wall.
...
One bottle of beer on the wall,
One bottle of beer,
Take one down, pass it around,
Zero bottles of beer on the wall.*/
