/* Points on a two-dimensional plane are specified uniquely using two numbers, the
 pointâ€™s distance from the horizontal x-axis, and its distance from the vertical y-axis.
 The distance between any two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) can be calculated using
 the formula: s = 2(x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2
 Write a program that reads in the x and y coordinates of two points on a plane, and
 calculates the distance between them using the above formula.
 Ensure that your program uses functions from the cmath library to perform the
 calculations.*/
