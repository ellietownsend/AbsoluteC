/* Write a function that computes the average and standard deviation of four scores.
 The standard deviation is defined to be the square root of the average of the four
 values: (si âˆ’ a )2, where a is the average of the four scores s1, s2, s3, and s

 The function will have six parameters and will call two other functions. Embed the function in a program that allows you to test the function again and again until you tell the program you are finished.*/
